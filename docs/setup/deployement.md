# Deployement

## Automatic Github Actions

Automatic Github Actions are available but disabled by default.
To enable them, uncomment the relevant blocks in the `.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml` and `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` files.

> _Example below of what you should uncomment to enable automatic deployment_

```

## 🔐 Github Actions secrets

In order for the Github workflows to correctly execute, you need to configure [Actions secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/secrets).
You can for sure define them manually in the Github GUI, but the easiest way to do it is through the CLI. Here are the steps to achieve it:

1. Install [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/) according to your system and preferences. (Homebrew is the easiest on Mac)
2. [Configure](https://cli.github.com/manual/#configuration) the CLI. -> `gh auth login` and follow the instructions
3. Copy `.env.github.example` file and edit the secrets. -> `cp .env.github.example .env.github`. ⚠️ Do not track this file in the repo as it is secrets
4. Push secrets to Github. -> `gh secret set --env-file .env.github`

> ℹ️ Deployments are done automatically through Github workflows. By default Next.js is deployed to Vercel, but there is a custom action `.github/actions/deploy-next` to deploy it to a custom server.

## 🚀 Production deployments

When we push to the `production` git branch, Next.js and WordPress are automatically deployed to production.

```
Next.js   -> https://yourdomain.com
WordPress -> https://admin.yourdomain.com
```

See `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` for more details.

## 👁 Preview deployments

When we push to any branch, or for any Merge Request:

-   Next.js is deployed on a preview URL on Vercel
-   WordPress is ignored if not `main` branch and Next will consume data from WordPress Staging

```
Next.js   -> https://yoursite-git-yourbranch.vercel.app
WordPress -> https://admin-staging.yourdomain.com
```

## 🔨 Custom deployments

Duplicate `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` file and edit the secrets to deploy WordPress and/or Next to a specific instance.

Be sure to not forget to add the custom action secrets to Github.
