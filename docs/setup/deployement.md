## üîê Github Actions variables and secrets

In order for the Github workflows to correctly execute, you need to configure [Actions variables](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/variables) and [Actions secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/secrets).
You can for sure define them manually in the Github GUI, but the easiest way to do it is through the CLI. Here are the steps to achieve it:

1. Install [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/) according to your system and preferences. (Homebrew is the easiest on Mac)
2. [Configure](https://cli.github.com/manual/#configuration) the CLI. -> `gh auth login` and follow the instructions
3. Push variables to Github. -> `gh variable set --env-file .env.github.variables.example`
4. Push secrets to Github. -> `gh secret set --env-file .env.github.secrets.example`
